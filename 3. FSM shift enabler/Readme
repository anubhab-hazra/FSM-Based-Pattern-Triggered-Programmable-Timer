This is the third component in a series of project that builds a complex counter out of several smaller circuits. See the final exercise for the overall design.

As part of the FSM for controlling the shift register, we want the ability to enable the shift register for exactly 4 clock cycles whenever the proper bit pattern is detected. We handle sequence detection in 2nd part, so this portion of the FSM only handles enabling the shift register for 4 cycles. Whenever the FSM is reset, assert shift_ena for 4 cycles, then 0 forever (until reset).
