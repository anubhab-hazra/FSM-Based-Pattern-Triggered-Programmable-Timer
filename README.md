# FSM-Based-Pattern-Triggered-Programmable-Timer
Verilog HDL implementation of a pattern-triggered programmable timer. Built step by step through modular FSM components — including a shift register, sequence recognizer, timed enable, and integrated counter — culminating in a fully functional programmable timer with handshake signaling.
